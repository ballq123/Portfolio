# Belle Connaught ‚Äì SWE & Embedded Systems Portfolio

Welcome! This repository highlights selected projects from my time at **Carnegie Mellon University (BS/MS in ECE, May 2025/2026)** and personal work.  
My focus areas include **software engineering, embedded systems, distributed systems, computer vision, and deep learning.**  

These are curated examples (not full class repos) to demonstrate code quality, design choices, and technical depth while still complying with relevant academic integrity policies.
