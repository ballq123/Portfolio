# Belle Connaught – SWE & Embedded Systems Portfolio

Welcome! This repository highlights selected projects from my time at **Carnegie Mellon University (BS/MS in ECE, May 2025/2026)** and personal work.  
My focus areas include **software engineering, embedded systems, distributed systems, computer vision, and deep learning.**  

These are curated examples (not full class repos) to demonstrate code quality, design choices, and technical depth while still complying with relevant academic integrity policies.

## Projects

> ⚠️ Note: This portfolio is actively being updated (Oct 2025). Additional projects (Motor Controller, Diffusion Pipeline, etc.) will be added soon.

- [**DrumLite – Portable Electronic Drum System**](DrumLite/README.md)  
  *ESP32, MPU-6050, FreeRTOS, OpenCV (Python/C++)*  
  - Delivered ~52ms end-to-end latency (vs. 100 ms goal) for real-time drum hit detection  
  - Accessibility-focused design enabling low-cost, portable musical expression  

- [**Distributed Bitcoin Miner – Systems Project**](DistributedMiner/README.md)  
  *Go, UDP networking, goroutines, fault tolerance*  
  - Implemented client-server architecture with dynamic job distribution  
  - Designed custom Live Sequence Protocol (LSP) for reliable concurrent networking
